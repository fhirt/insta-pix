# node-basic
This basic node app displays a users recent instagram pictures. It is based on a tutorial from https://scotch.io I used this app to learn about several topics:
1. create a http server with express as a framework
2. use the instagram-node package to access the instagram developer API
3. use the EJS templating engine
4. use the dotenv package to hide a secret access token
